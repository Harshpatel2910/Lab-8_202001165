1.I created a new Java project in eclipse  name <b>Lab_8_202001165</b> and created a package inside it with name <b>test</b>

2.I then created a class with name Boa and then added  code inside it.

3.Then I created a JUnit test file for the Boa Class name BoaTest2

4.Then I modified the setUp method to initialize the variables.

5.Then I also implemented tests for the given two functions testIsHealthy(),testFitsInCage() and testlengthInInches()

6.Then I ran the Junit test file and all the tests are passed.There are no red bars in the output.

It can be seen that 2 out of 2 test cases have been passed.

7.Then I added a new method to the Boa class with name lenghtInInches() to get the length in inches.


8.Then I wrote another test case for this new method and ran the 3 test cases together.
